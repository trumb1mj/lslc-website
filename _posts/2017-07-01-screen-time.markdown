Nowadays, it's very rare for a family to avoid screen time completely.
For many parents, allowing their children to watch TV or use a device
seems like the only way to accomplish certain tasks (e.g., cooking,
cleaning, feeding a sibling, etc.) Moreover, our modern kids love to use
technology. If there's any such thing as a "sure thing" when it comes to
children's preferences, it's likely a screen of some sort.

The bad news is, most research points to increasing amounts of screen
time resulting in negative effects on children's development. We know
that children learn from interaction, and they learn better when
interacting with the "real" 3-dimensional world. One recent study found
that children who spent more time with handheld devices were more likely
to have expressive speech and language delays. With each additional 30
minutes of screen time, the children were 49% more likely to have an
expressive language delay.

This post is not meant to scold parents for allowing screen time or tell
you how to parent in the age of digital media. We know that every family
has different perspectives on the use of screens, and those views should
be respected. However, when using technology with your children, here
are some ways to promote interaction and downplay the negative effects:

1. Pair apps with real life toys (e.g., a farm set with the Old
MacDonald song app)

2. Use as a tool for learning, not as entertainment

3. Limit screen time

-   There's an app for that! Screentime Labs offers a free and premium
    version of their app, which helps track and control children's
    screen use. Check it out at https://screentimelabs.com/

-   The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends avoiding screen
    use with children under 18 months altogether (except for Facetime or
    Skype to communicate with family members, of course)

-   After 18 months of age, the AAP recommends no more than 1 hour per
    day of screen time. They also recommend limiting the content to
    "high quality"

4. Use as a reward/reinforcement for good behavior

5. Designate "media-free times" for family (e.g., dinner, driving, etc.)
and "media-free zones" in the house to further limit media consumption.
