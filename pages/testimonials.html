I reached out to Lakeview Speech for an evaluation for my child. Initially I emailed Tracy about setting up the evaluation. We then set up a time to speak on the phone to discuss the situation in further detail. She was very helpful and told me that another therapist, Erica, would be getting in touch shortly to schedule the evaluation. We set up the appointment shortly thereafter. 
<br><br>
Erica arrived at our home right on time and was wonderful, patient, responsive, and knows her stuff! I was very impressed. We also decided to do an evaluation at my child's school which was easily scheduled. My child's teachers noted how great Erica was- they were also impressed. 
<br><br>
I was very happy with the knowledge and services of this group!

        I am so grateful to be working with Lakeview Speech and Language Clinic. Tracy was very responsive to all of my questions when I first sought her out, and helped answer all of my crazy questions. Our speech therapist, Erica, is so great with our 5-year old son. It has probably been about half a year now, and we have seen so much progress in his language development. Our son looks forward to his speech sessions and has fun while learning. I love receiving the detailed summary after each session, as well as helpful / relevant assignments that we can print out and work with at home. Erica is engaging, patient, friendly and professional. The activities continue to evolve as our son's language develops, and it's clear that the plan is individualized and personalized to his specific needs. As you know, there is no "one-size-fits-all" plan for these kind of things.

        We could not be any happier with Lakeview Speech and Language Clinic. If you are looking for a speech therapist for your child, just call up Tracy. She is the best!

        Lakeview Speech and Language is excellent. I could not be happier with Tracy and Erica. After every session they send detailed notes and an assignment to work on.  They also come to the school which is worth its weight in gold.

        Tracy Trumbell has been working with my 8 year old son since September. While providing speech services, she was able to build a relationship with him. As a result, he looks forward to her coming to provide her services and he enjoys each session. Tracy is always attentive and encouraging. My son always seems to have fun while he works. He has made so much progress with her. We are happy with the services she provides and are glad that were able to find her.

      Tracy Trumbell is a wonderful speech therapist.  We have been working with her since we noticed a speech delay in our daughter when she was 19 months old. Since then Tracy has been a wonderful resource for us as our daughter faces other challenges.  She always provides a summary of our session and homework to work on throughout the week.  It is really nice that she comes to our house, and that she is in network with Blue Cross Blue Shield.  We are very fortunate to have found her and will continue to work with her!

      Tracy has been working with our son since February, and she is great.  When we first called Tracy to discuss our son's speech delay, she was very thoughtful in answering all of our questions.  We've seen so much improvement since he started working with Tracy, and he has much more confidence using his words, which has helped in other areas, including separating and interacting with others.  She always follows up after each session with session notes and recommendations for things we should work on during the week.  Tracy is a caring professional, who clearly loves working with her students, and we would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a speech therapist for their child.

      Tracy has been working with our six year old for a few months and we have been extremely impressed with her.  After receiving therapy through our local school district for two years, we were not seeing the progress that we had hoped for.  She made the transition into private care so easy, we were upset that we hadn't started with her sooner.  Our son looks forward to every session that they have together and we are already seeing changes in his language.  We could not be more pleased!

      Tracy is the most amazing speech therapist- and our family has been around the block with therapists. We have seen therapists in the hospital setting, and through private practice, and I can say unequivocally that Lakeview Speech is the best in the business. Tracy is extremely knowledgeable about speech therapy, speech disorders, articulation disorders, and everything in between. She is great with children - nurturing and compassionate, while also motivating and encouraging. She is amazing - gained my daughter's trust in the first session, and my 3 year old looks forward to every session. Tracy gets results too -- sometimes with speech therapy, it's hard to see the forest through the trees, and Tracy keeps the progress moving at a steady rate without overwhelming my daughter. She brings excellent activities to work on, keeps us 100% informed of what to do, homework for us to complete with my daughter, and is totally open to questions and concerns. I always feel that she genuinely cares for my daughter and is as excited about my daughter's progress as we are. I felt so relieved when we began working with Tracy - we went from severe articulation and speech delays/problems -- and now are lightyears from where we began, only one year later.

      Working with Tracy is wonderful. She is genuine, talented, and caring - you will not find a better therapist out there! I will be grateful to her forever for helping my sweet three year old find her voice and unlock the ability to speak. It is a gift - and all because of her talents! Wish I could rate higher than five stars....​

      <p>I don't write many reviews, but I had to write about Tracy Trumbell.  We just loved her.  My son had just been released from EI in April, and we really felt that he needed to continue speech services over the summer before entering the school district's phonological program.  I couldn't have found a better speech therapist for my son!  What was meant to just be a bridge of sorts turned into us staying with her until he "graduated" from speech services. You can tell Tracy loves what she does and she does it well.  She is resourceful, has great learning activities, and provides "homework" for you to work on in between sessions.  My son really looked forward to seeing her and had no idea it was for speech. Her enthusiasm is genuine and I really felt that that played a big part in his progress.</p>

      <p>Fast forward a couple of years and I'm currently trying to figure out a way so that my middle son can see her too. (Our insurance changed.)</p>

      We have been working with Tracy Trumbell for the last month for our 2 year old boy with language delay. From the beginning, we noticed many strengths Tracy exhibited in her role as a speech and language pathologist.

      She is extremely organized and has tremendous skill in what she does.  Tracy notified us about the billing and evaluation process ahead of time so we knew what to expect in terms of insurance paperwork and billing.  She assessed our son with standardized outcome measures and submitted a formal report to us and our son's pediatrician specifying long and short term goals.  We have since had several treatment sessions with Tracy and she consistently follows up with detailed progress notes and  activities we can do with our son to facilitate his language development. Tracy provides this information to us the day of our son's treatment sessions and provides visual instructions as needed to further explain short and long term goals she has established.

      We are so glad we have chosen Tracy as our speech and language pathologist , as the improvements we have seen in a month have been so rewarding to see for our son.  He is more animated, produces  more verbal speech and sign language , and also engages in more pretend play (all appropriate for his age).

      We highly recommend Tracy's services!​

      <p>Tracy was great, and I would highly recommend her practice.

      I contacted her after I was concerned about a possible language delay in my two year old son.  He had been experiencing chronic ear infections, and seemed (to me) to be a little delayed compared to some of his peers.

      My doctor suggested that I call ei, which turned out to not be so helpful FOR ME, so I did a little research on my own.  That's how I found Tracy.

      She came to our house at a time that was convenient for us, and was so kind with my son.  After her assessment, it turns out that he is within normal limits for his age, so we will not need to continue with therapy.

      However, my rating is for her flexibility, kindness, professionalism, and honest expert opinion!  She really put my mind at ease.  Also, she is very responsive, which is meaningful to me as well.

      If you are looking for a speech and language therapist for your child, and are as confused by all the options as I was, I recommend giving Tracy a call to see how she can help you.​
