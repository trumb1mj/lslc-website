      <h3>New Clients</h3>
      <p>We look forward to working with your child and family!</p>
      <p>Please download and complete the <a href="http://cl.ly/VF2C/download/LSLC%20SLH%20Case%20Hx%20form.pdf">Speech and Language Case History Form</a> prior to your evaluation appointment.</p>
      <p>If your child has additional reports from a medical diagnostic, school, or other therapies, please download and complete the <a href="http://cl.ly/VERV/download/LSLC%20Information%20Release%20form.pdf">Information Release Form</a>; please bring the completed Information Release Form, as well as copies of the additional reports, to your evaluation appointment.</p>
      <p>We are an in-network provider with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois - PPO. Please call Blue Cross Blue Shield to check your benefits prior to your evaluation appointment. This will greatly expedite our ability to start your child’s therapy! Then download and complete the <a href="http://cl.ly/VFV0/download/LSLC%20In%20Network%20Priv%20Ins%20Financial%20Policy%20form.pdf">In-Network Private Insurance Financial Policy Form</a> prior to your evaluation appointment. We are able to work with all other insurance companies as an out-of-network provider.</p>
      <p>We also offer a 20% discount per visit if you wish to privately pay for services. Privately paying for services allows you to directly receive the insurance reimbursement, after submitting claims on your own behalf. Each month, we supply an invoice of therapy services including all required information needed for submission to your insurance company. Please download and complete the <a href="http://cl.ly/VFdu/download/LSLC%20Private%20Pay%20Financial%20Policy%20form.pdf">Private Pay Financial Policy Form</a> prior to your evaluation appointment.</p>
      <p>At the time of enrollment, we will ask you to complete our <a href="http://cl.ly/VEre/download/LSLC%20HIPPA%20form.pdf">Privacy Practice Form</a>, <a href="https://cl.ly/2N0Z1F1C1C0L/download/LSLC%20Cancellation_Attendance%20Policy%20form.pdf">Therapy Visit Cancellation Policy Form</a>, <a href="http://cl.ly/VEd8/download/LSLC%20Photography%20Release%20form.pdf">Photo Release Form</a>, and <a href="https://cl.ly/3e1R0m3r0e2G/download/LSLC%20Communication%20preference%20form.pdf">Communication Preference Form</a>. We also require copies of your valid Driver’s License, Insurance Card front and back (if billing Blue Cross Blue Shield), and valid credit card front and back to keep in your child’s file. Therapy services cannot begin until we have all completed forms and copies.</p>
      <p>We appreciate your preparedness for your child’s evaluation!</p>
