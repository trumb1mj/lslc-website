      <h3>New Clients</h3>
      <p>We look forward to working with your child and family!</p>
      <p>Upon scheduling services, we will send you a Welcome e-mail to access our software system.  Please follow the directions to create a log-in and complete the Intake and Consent forms prior to your evaluation appointment.</p>
      <p>We are an in-network provider with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois - PPO, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois - Blue Choice Preferred PPO, and United Healthcare PPO. Please call your insurance to check your benefits prior to your evaluation appointment. This will greatly expedite our ability to start your child’s therapy!  We are able to work with all other insurance companies as an out-of-network provider.</p>
      <p>We also offer a 20% discount per visit if you wish to privately pay for services. Privately paying for services allows you to directly receive the insurance reimbursement, after submitting claims on your own behalf. Each month, we supply an invoice of therapy services including all required information needed for submission to your insurance company.</p>
      <p>We appreciate your preparedness for your child’s evaluation!</p>
